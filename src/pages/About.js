        <h2>What is San Andreas State Roleplay</h2>
Well San Andreas State Roleplay most known as SASRP is a vMenu server which provides a unique experience <br/> full of interesting places to visit
here as SASRP we have a reliable staff team and a great community we offer <br/> so much in our server from the LEO departments to the huge roleplay possibilities
we have a whole arsenal of vehicles assigned to each department we have a massive range of civilian cars which is in a custom vehicle spawner in the community we have many great aspects for example we are a whitelisted community meaning we only accept serious people and have a low amount of toxic people and rule-breakers we have invested a lot of money and time into the server ensuring our members get the best scripts and Y-MAPS around.
<br/><br/>
Here at SASRP we have many places you can get involved such as certified gangs and certified civilian where you can gain access to a whole bunch of different RP
capabilities including Detective Roleplay, Animal Roleplay, Hitman Roleplay and more, We have built the community so you can easily navigate through our system we have in place such as the bug reports feature where you can report any issues within the servers development and you can also apply for a department and if you don't want to fill out applications then you can even be a community officer, That's not even everything thanks,
